# Secondary integration: annotated refinement (`--annotated-run`)

After clustering and annotation, `integrate` can be run a **second time** in a supervised refinement mode.

This mode is **optional** and intended for producing cleaner embeddings and UMAPs after final biological labels are known.

#### Key properties

* **Not the default mode**
* **Requires manual input and output naming**
* **Runs scANVI only**
* **Does not overwrite previous results**

#### What it does

1. Takes an *annotated* dataset (from `cluster-and-annotate`) as input
2. Extracts final cluster labels from the selected cluster round
3. Reconstructs a CellTypist confidence mask
4. Uses only high-confidence cells as supervision
5. Trains scANVI to *project* all cells into a refined latent space
6. Benchmarks embeddings using the chosen truth labels
7. Creates a derived *projection round* to preserve clustering state

Low-confidence cells are labeled as `Unknown` for supervision, preventing overfitting to noisy annotations.

#### Required usage pattern

You **must** explicitly set:

* the input path (annotated dataset)
* a new output name (there is no default)

Example:

```bash
scomnom integrate \
  --input-path results/cluster_and_annotate/adata.clustered.annotated.zarr \
  --annotated-run \
  --output-dir results/integrate_annotated/ \
  --output-name adata.clustered.annotated.projected \
  --benchmark-n-jobs 16
```

Notes:

* The input must point to an **annotated** object
* The output name is **not auto-derived**
* Results are additive and non-destructive
